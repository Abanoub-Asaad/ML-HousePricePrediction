# House Price Prediction
Growing unaffordability of housing has become one of the major challenges for metropolitan cities around the world. In order to gain a better understanding of the commercialized housing market we are currently facing; we want to figure out what are the top influential factors of the housing price. Apart from the more obvious driving forces such as the inflation and the scarcity of land, there are also several variables that are worth looking into. The task here is to reach a model that can closely predict the pricing of a house.
